- updated the main page of project\
- searched for validation data sets to used, seems the DREAM Challenge Somatic calling will be a good resource. They have both real cancer/normal pairs and simulated data to use.\
- Want to find additional data set besides DREAM\
- Searched different callers to call real duplication not the tandem duplication. LUMPY, MANTA, DELLY all don't support this. GATK published their workflow for CNV calling. Research that tomorrow.
